**Files modified:**
- `_data/data.yml` - 5 sections updated
- `_data/experience.yml` - 6 job entries updated

### Phase 2: PDF Generation

**Status:** Found existing PDFs but Python not available in terminal to regenerate
- `Burak_Kalafat_Professional_CV.pdf` - Main professional CV
- `Burak_Kalafat_ATS_CV.pdf` - ATS-friendly version
- `BURAK_KALAFAT.pdf` - Legacy version

**Action:** Will review existing PDF visually, then user can regenerate locally with:
```powershell
python -m pip install reportlab Pillow pyyaml
python generate_beautiful_cv.py
```

### Phase 3: Playwright Visual Review

**Current Blocker:** Cannot proceed with visual review because:
1. Python not available in PowerShell terminal (`python` command not found)
2. Jekyll not installed (cannot serve local HTML preview)
3. Playwright cannot directly render PDF files for inspection

**Required Action from User:**
To continue with comprehensive visual review, please run locally:
```powershell
# Install Python dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install reportlab Pillow pyyaml

# Generate updated PDF with new YAML content
python generate_beautiful_cv.py

# Open the generated PDF
start Burak_Kalafat_Professional_CV.pdf
```

**What to Check After Generation:**
1. ✅ "Professional Profile" heading (was "Career Profile")
2. ✅ No "60,000-line" numeric claims in summary
3. ✅ "Agent and custom modes" (not "Ask/Edit modes")
4. ✅ All post-TUBITAK job titles show "Senior Software Engineer (Backend, .NET)"
5. ✅ Skills section shows "Microservices Architecture (Training)" at 70%
6. ✅ Skills section shows "C# and .NET Core" at 98% (not "Microservices")
7. ✅ Akbank description says "large-scale legacy modernization" not microservices conversion

**Layout Review Points:**
- Blue sidebar width - is it optimal or should it be narrower?
- Sidebar only on page 1 (page 2+ full width) - correct behavior?
- Font rendering, bold markers, spacing
- Turkish character support (ı, ğ, ş, etc.)
- Clickable links (email, LinkedIn, GitHub)

### Phase 4: Layout Analysis Completed

**Sidebar Width Analysis:**
- Current: 65mm (31% of A4 width = 210mm)
- Behavior: Sidebar only on page 1, subsequent pages full-width ✅
- Assessment: **Optimal ratio** - professional and balanced
- Recommendation: **No change needed** unless user preference differs

**Generator Configuration:**
- Location: `generate_beautiful_cv.py` line 66
- Color: Navy blue (#2B5A8F) with white text for WCAG compliance
- Multi-page: Correct implementation (sidebar only on first page)

**Current Code (line 66):**
```python
sidebar_width = 65*mm  # 31% of A4 width - professional ratio
```

**Alternative Options (if narrower sidebar desired):**
- 55mm (26%) - More content space, slightly cramped sidebar
- 60mm (29%) - Balanced middle option
- 65mm (31%) - **Current (RECOMMENDED)**
- 70mm (33%) - More sidebar prominence

### Phase 5: Summary and Next Steps

**✅ Completed Actions:**
1. ✅ Updated `_data/data.yml` - 8 specific content changes
2. ✅ Updated `_data/experience.yml` - 6 job title corrections
3. ✅ Created `memory.md` documentation
4. ✅ Analyzed generator layout configuration
5. ✅ Identified optimal sidebar width (no change needed)

**⏸️ Blocked (User Action Required):**
Cannot proceed with visual PDF review because Python environment not available in this terminal session.

**User Must Run Locally:**
```powershell
cd C:\Work\cv
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install reportlab Pillow pyyaml
python generate_beautiful_cv.py
start Burak_Kalafat_Professional_CV.pdf
```

**After PDF Generation, Verify:**
1. ✅ "Professional Profile" heading
2. ✅ No "60,000-line" claims
3. ✅ "Agent and custom modes" wording
4. ✅ All Senior Software Engineer titles post-TUBITAK
5. ✅ Microservices at 70% in skills (Training notation)
6. ✅ C# and .NET Core at 98% (without Microservices)
7. ✅ Bold rendering, Turkish characters, clickable links

**For Next Session:**
If layout changes needed after visual inspection:
- Sidebar width: Edit line 66 in `generate_beautiful_cv.py`
- Colors: Edit line 26 (SIDEBAR_COLOR)
- Spacing: Font sizes and margins throughout generate function

**Session Status: 80% Complete**
- Content updates: ✅ Done
- Documentation: ✅ Done
- Visual verification: ⏸️ Pending user PDF generation
